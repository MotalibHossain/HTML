<h1><p align="center">2. Paragraphs</p></h1>


### HTML Paragraphs
```
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.

A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space 
(a margin) before and after a paragraph.

Example:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### HTML Display

```
You cannot be sure how HTML will be displayed.

Large or small screens, and resized windows will create different results.

With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your 
HTML code.

The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed

Example:

<p>
This paragraph
contains a lot of lines
in the source code,
but the browser 
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
This paragraph
contains      a lot of spaces
in the source     code,
but the    browser 
ignores it.
</p>

<p>
The number of lines in a paragraph depends on the size of the browser window. 
If you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will change.
</p>
